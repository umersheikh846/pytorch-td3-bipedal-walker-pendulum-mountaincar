# Pytorch TD3 

## Introduction
Pytorch implementation of TD3 agent to solve the OpenAI gym problems. Since TD3 only works with continous action space environment, so this implementation is tested on 3 different environments. The complexity of these environments is in the order. We start with the easy problems and then test on the more complicated one. tBipendal Walker is the toughest among thses three problems and this TD3 agent performed well on it as well. 

## Requirements

-   Python 3.6
-   Pytorch 1.8.1
-   OpenAI Gym 0.22.0
-   Matplotlib
-   PyVirtualDisplay
